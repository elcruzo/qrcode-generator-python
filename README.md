## Introduction

The following code contains a simple QR Code generator available for your utilization.

## Dependencies

To run this implementation, you need:

- Python 3.x
- The `qrcode` module

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elcruzo/qrcode-generator-python.git
   cd qrcode-generator-python
   ```

2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. You can check by running:

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

   If Python is not installed, you can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

3. Install the `qrcode` library by running:
    ```bash
   pip install qrcode
   ```

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory containing the `index.py` file.

2. Open the `index.py` file in your preferred text editor or IDE.

3. Run the `index.py` script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python3 index.py
   ```

6. Upon execution, the script will convert the object in Line 8 (in this case, it is the link to the website where I have my timeline) to a QR Code saved as "myqrcode.png". You can replace the object on Line 8 with anything of your choice.

7. You may find the saved QR Code as an image stored in the directory that your local machine's terminal begins with.


## Example

Here's a brief example of how to run the code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/elcruzo/qrcode-generator-python.git
cd qrcode-generator-python
python3 index.py
```
